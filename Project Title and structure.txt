🧠 Project Title: Intune-Like MDM Simulation
🎯 Objective:
To simulate a lightweight Mobile Device Management (MDM) system using Python that:

Enforces device policies (e.g., password length, encryption, firewall status).

Collects and logs compliance data from endpoints.

Generates device compliance reports via Power BI dashboards.

⚙️ Tech Stack
Language: Python 3.x

Database: SQLite (lightweight for simulation)

Reporting: Power BI Desktop

OS Compatibility: Windows 10/11 (Simulated endpoints)
